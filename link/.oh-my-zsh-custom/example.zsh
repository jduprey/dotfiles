# You can put files here to add functionality separated per file, which

# Files on the custom/ directory will be automatically loaded by the init
# script, in alphabetical order.

# For example: add yourself some shortcuts to projects you often work on.

# brainstormr=~/Projects/development/planetargon/brainstormr
# cd $brainstormr
